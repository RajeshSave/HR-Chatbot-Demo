# IMPORTANT: It's best practice to load your API key from environment variables for security.
# For this demo, we'll try to get it from an environment variable first.
# If not found, a message will appear.
# Remember to set this in your Spyder IPython Console using:
# import os
# os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"
